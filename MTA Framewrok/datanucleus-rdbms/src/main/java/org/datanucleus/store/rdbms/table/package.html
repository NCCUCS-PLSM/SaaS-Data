<BODY>
    Provides the internal DataNucleus definition of a table/view and its columns.
    Tables/Views can represent a (persistent) class, or can be a join table for the relation between classes.
    Additionally there are special cases of <B>SchemaTable</B>, <B>ProbeTable</B>, and <B>SequenceTable</B> 
    which provide auto-start, table detection, and table-based sequences.
