    <P>Package containing mappings for datastore (JDBC) types. These mappings will be mapped via the RDBMSMappingManager to 
        the various java type mappings in org.datanucleus.store.mapped.mapping.</P>
    <P>These are datastore (JDBC) types, and probably most of them are atomic types mapping to atomic java types</P>
    <P>Mappings map persistent java fields in PersistenceCapable classes to columns in RDBMS tables. Mappings are also 
        used to map "non-fields" in PersistenceCapable classes to columns in RDBMS tables. A class using datastore identity 
        does not have java fields representing primary-keys in RDBMS tables, but as said ealier a Mapping is also applied to 
        "non-fields". Therefore, a Mapping is applied to:
    </P>
    <UL>
        <LI>persistent java fields</LI>
        <LI>datastore identity (primary-key columns)</LI>
        <LI>optimistic columns (columns with version numbers)</LI>
        <LI>index columns (columns indexing an ordered list)</LI>
        <LI>owner columns in unidirectional inverse relationships</LI>
        <LI>adapter columns (additional column added as primary key when the existing columns have datatype not allowed, 
            by database limitation, to be part of the primary key)</LI>
    </UL>
    <P>
        In addition to the representation of columns in tables for PersistenceCapable classes, Mappings are also used for representing
        fields in queries.
